### This is a CSS/HTML project having as purpose to create a Tribute Page by fulfilling a series of user stories.

### Below you can find the project summary and the source link.

## Technology Stack

1. You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS.

## Content

1. My tribute page should have an element with corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
2. I should see an element with corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
3. I should see a <div> element with corresponding id="img-div".
4. Within the "img-div" element, I should see an <img> element with a corresponding id="image".
5. Within the "img-div" element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in "img-div".
6. I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
7. I should see an anchor element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page.

## Layout

1. The <img> element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
2. The <img> element should be centered within its parent element
